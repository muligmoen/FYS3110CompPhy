#Project 3

This project aims to compute the correlation energy between two electrons in the helium atom taking as ansatz two hydrogen 1s-orbitals.

##Installation
Open the terminal in this folder and type

```
make
```

This makes two executables, project3 and testit. 

##Usage
In the terminal type

```
./project3
```

This should give the input parameters required to run the program. To run the unit test the executable testit must be run,

```
./testit
```
