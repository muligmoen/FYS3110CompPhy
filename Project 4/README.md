#Project 4
This project aims to find the critical temperature and some other parameters of the two-dimensional Ising model.


##Installation
Open the terminal in this folder and type

```
make
```

This makes three executables, project3, testit and animation. 

##Usage

```
./project4
```

This should give the input parameters required to run the program. To run the unit test the executable testit must be run,

```

```

For a visual look at the evolution of the system run
