\section{Introduction}

The Ising model is a simple model of a solid. A lattice with elements 
each have a spin. This interaction between the different spin states
give an energy. The net amount of spin in the 
lattice leads to an overall magnetisation. 

Which energy the lattice 
is permitted to have is controlled by a large heat reservoir. If 
the temperature is large, the spins tends to be randomly aligned, 
and there is no net magnetisation. The highest temperature which 
allows a magnetisation is called the Curie temperature, and is 
connected to a phase transition.

The programs belonging to this report is available at 
\url{https://github.com/mulimoen/FYS3150CompPhy} under Project 4.

\section{Theory}

The energy of a spin system in the Ising model is given by
\begin{gather}
E = -J\sum_{\expval{kl}}^N s_k s_l
\end{gather}
Here J is the energy shared between two lattice points. The elements 
$s_i = \pm 1$ gives the spin associated with 
the lattice point.

The summation $\expval{kl}$ only sums over pairwise interactions.
Another way of writing the sum is to only consider the forward 
interaction between the lattice points,
\begin{gather}
E = -J \sum_{k}^N s_k s_{k+1}
\label{eq:Esum}
\end{gather}
This sum faces a boundary problem. In our model we are solving this 
by using periodic boundary conditions,
\begin{gather}
s_k = s_{k \pm L}
\label{eq:boundary}
\end{gather}
An illustration of this is visible in figure \ref{fig:spin_neighbours_full}.
Here the spin $S_2$ faces $S_4$ both on the upper and lower site.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.15]{pics/simple_lattice.png}
\caption{ Illustration of the simple, ''$L=2$''-lattice and a graphical interpretation the periodic boundary conditions.}
\label{fig:spin_neighbours_full}
\end{figure}

The magnetisation of the lattice is given by the sum of the spins,
\begin{gather}
\magM = \sum_i s_i
\label{eq:Msum}
\end{gather}


\subsection{Statistical mechanics}
In order to find how the energy and magnetisation is in the steady-state
solution some results from statistical mechanics is employed. These 
give expectation values in the thermodynamic limit, which is the limit 
where the number of samplings and particles goes to infinity.

The steady-state solution has a close connection to the temperature 
of the system. If our system is connected to a heat reservoir, we can
give the probability by the Boltzmann probability function,
where he probability to find the system in a microstate is given by
\begin{gather}
p(i) = \frac{e^{-E_i\beta}}{Z}
\end{gather}
Where $E_i$ is the energy for the microstate, $\beta = \frac{1}{kT}$ 
and Z is the partition function. The partition function works as the 
normalisation factor, and is given by
\begin{gather}
Z = \sum_i \exp(-\beta E_i)
\end{gather}

\subsubsection{Energy}
The energy of the system can be calculated from the partition function
by the equation
\begin{gather}
\expval{E} = -\frac{d \ln Z}{d \beta}
\end{gather}
One useful quantity is the heat capacity, how much energy the system 
retains when changing the temperature. This quantity is given by
\begin{gather}
C_v = \frac{d\expval{E}}{dT} 
= -\frac{\beta^2}{k}\frac{d\expval{E}}{d\beta}
 = \frac{\beta^2}{k}\frac{d^2\ln Z}{d^2\beta}
\end{gather}
Another way to write this
\begin{gather}
C_v = N\beta^2 \left(\expval{E^2} -\expval{E}^2\right)
\end{gather}
with $\expval{E}$ given per particle.




\subsubsection{Magnetisation}
From the partition function the magnetisation can be found. If all the 
states with a certain magnetisation is known, 
\begin{gather}
\expval{\magM} = \sum_i m_i p(m_i) = \sum_i \frac{M_i e^{-E_i\beta}}{Z}
\end{gather}
Another important quantity is the susceptibility. This is how much 
magnetisation is reatained when the temperature changes,
\begin{gather}
\chi = \frac{d \expval{\magM}}{d T} 
= -\frac{\beta^2}{k}\frac{d\expval{\magM}}{d\beta}
\end{gather}

\begin{gather}
\chi = N\beta^2 \left(\expval{M^2} - \expval{M}^2\right)
\end{gather}


\subsection{Example of a system}
For the simple case of only two spins in each dimension($L=2$)
the energies are summed by \eqref{eq:Esum}.
The energy a function of the different spins,
\begin{equation}
E = -2J(s_1s_2 + s_1s_3 + s_2s_4 + s_3s_4)
\end{equation}
This has symmetries with regards to which spin is up.
Listing up all the different spin configurations, their degeneracy 
and the energies,
\begin{gather*}
\text{Spin configuration} = 
\begin{cases}
n_{up} = 0, \quad d=1, \quad E = -8J\\
n_{up} = 1, \quad d=4, \quad E = 0\\
n_{up} = 2, \quad d=6, \quad 
\begin{cases} 
\text{diag} \quad d = 2, \quad E = 8J\\
\text{non-diag} \quad d = 4, \quad E = 0
\end{cases}\\
n_{up} = 3, \quad d=4, \quad E = 0\\
n_{up} = 4, \quad d=1, \quad E = -8J
\end{cases}
\end{gather*}
The energies with their degeneracy is then
\begin{gather}
E = 
\begin{cases}
-8J, \quad d = 2\\
\phantom{-}0, \quad\quad d = 12\\
\phantom{-}8J, \quad d = 2
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
And the (absolute) magnetisation is
\begin{gather}
\abs{\magM} = 
\begin{cases}
4, \quad d = 2,\quad E = -8J\\
2, \quad d = 8, \quad E = 0\\
0, \quad
\begin{cases}
d = 2, \quad E = 8J\\
d = 4, \quad E = 0
\end{cases}
\end{cases}
\end{gather}
The partition function for this system is 
\begin{gather}
Z = \sum_i d(i) e^{-E_i\beta} = 2e^{+8J\beta}+12e^{0}+2e^{-8J\beta}
 = 12 + 4\cosh(8J\beta)
\end{gather}


\subsubsection{Analytical solutions}
Using the partition function we obtain an expression for the energy;
\begin{gather}
\expval{E} = \frac{-32J\sinh(8J\beta)}{4\cosh(8J\beta)+12}
\end{gather}
magnetisation;
\begin{gather}
\expval{\abs{\magM}} = \frac{\abs{\magM_i}e^{-E_i\beta}}{Z}
= \frac{4e^{8J\beta} + 2}{12+4\cosh(8J\beta))}
\end{gather}
heat capacity;
\begin{gather}
C_v = -\frac{\beta^2}{k}\left(\frac{-256J^2\cosh(8J\beta)}{4\cosh(8J\beta) + 12}
 + \frac{1024J^2\sinh(8J\beta)^2}{(12+4\cosh(8J\beta))^2}\right)
\end{gather}
and magnetic susceptibility;
\begin{gather}
\chi = -\frac{\beta^2}{k}\left(- \frac{32 J \left(4 e^{8 J \beta} + 2\right) \sinh{\left (8 J \beta \right )}}{
\left(4 \cosh{\left (8 J \beta \right )} + 12\right)^{2}} 
+ \frac{32 J e^{8 J \beta}}{4 \cosh(8 J \beta) + 12}\right)
\end{gather}
The heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility follows from the derivative 
of $\expval{E}$ and $\expval{\abs{\magM}}$.

\subsection{1-D Ising model}
Solutions for the Ising model in one dimension in the 
thermodynamic limit are known (Plischke and Bergersen, 1994). 

\begin{equation}
\frac{U}{J} = -N \tanh \left( \frac{J}{k_B T} \right) = -N \frac{e^{J/k_B T}-e^{-J/k_B T} }{e^{J/k_B T}+ e^{-J/k_B T} } =  \begin{cases} N, \quad k_B T \to 0 \\ 0, \quad  k_B T \to \infty \end{cases}
\end{equation}

The specific heat per particle and the magnetisation are given by 

\begin{equation}
C(T) = \frac{1}{N} \frac{dU}{dT} = \frac{(J/k_B T)^2}{cosh^2 (J/k_B T)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\magM(T) = \frac{N e^{J / k_B T} sinh(B/k_B T) }{ \sqrt{ e^{2J/k_B T} sinh^2 (B/k_B T) + e^{-2J/ k_B T}  } }
\end{equation}

\subsection{2-D Ising model}
There are known analytical solution to the two dimensional model as well (Huang ,1987),
\begin{equation}
\magM (T) = \begin{cases} 0, \quad T > T_C \\ \frac{(1+z^2)^{1/4} (1-6z^2 + z^4 )^{1/8} }{(1-z^2)^{1/2}}, \quad T < T_C \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
k T_C/J = \frac{2}{\ln(1+ \sqrt{2}) } \approx 2.269
\end{equation}

here $T_C$ is the \emph{Curie temperature} and $z = e^{-2J/k_B T}$. This result was originally derived by Lars Onsager.

\section{Implementation/Numerical}

The numerical model of the Ising model has been programmed in C++ and is 
available in the repository given in the introduction.
Most of the program code is well documented, and is available in the 
repository given above. The classes are tested using unittest 
implemented in Catch, \url{https://github.com/philsquared/Catch}.

In this program a lattice class with periodic boundary conditions is given,
so access of an element follows the requirement in \eqref{eq:boundary}.
The energy of an element in the 
lattice and the total energy is calculated from the definition
of the energy, \eqref{eq:Esum}.

As a bonus a small program to plot the Ising model live is included. 
This allows one to see how the domains are connected to the temperature.
This program is available by running \emph{make animation}.


\subsection{The metropolis algorithm}

The probability of transition from i to j 
is modelled by the Boltzmann coefficient
\begin{gather}
w_j = \exp(-\beta (E_i - E_j))
\end{gather}
This suggest the following probabilities for moving to this state:
\begin{gather}
p = \begin{cases}
1 \quad\text{ if }  E_i - E_j \le 0\\
\exp(-\beta \Delta E) \text{ else}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:transition}
\end{gather}
This probability is compared with a random number generated from 
the computer. To avoid computing this exponential for each new state,
the total transition is modelled by flipping a single spin. The energy 
difference between the two microstates is computed by considering 
a a spin $S_0$ surrounded by $S_1,S_2,S_3, S_4$, as in figure 
\ref{fig:spin_neighbours}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{pics/full_lattice.png}
\caption{ Illustration of $S_0$ and its "nearest neighbours".}
\label{fig:spin_neighbours}
\end{figure}

This gives a flip of spin $s_0$ results in a n
energy-difference of the lattice which is
 -2 times the energy of $s_0$.
\begin{gather}
\Delta E = -2s_0(s_1 + s_2 + s_3 + s_4)
\end{gather}
This is clearly quantized, and the exponential function in 
\eqref{eq:transition} is precomputed to save computations.


This can be summarized in the following algorithm:
\begin{algorithm}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
\item Choose start configuration. Common choices of the Ising model 
are random ($T= \infty$) and ordered ($T= 0$). 
\item Pick a random particle, $s_0$ by drawing two random integers,
$x$ and $y$ in the lattice domain.
\item Suggest a spin-flip and compute possible change in 
energy $\Delta E$.
\begin{align*} 
\Delta E = -2s_0(s_1+s_2+s_3+s_4), \quad \Delta E \in \{-8,-4,0,4,8 \} 
\end{align*} 
\item \textsc{If} $\Delta E \leq 0 \quad \to$ Accept spin-flip. \\
\textsc{Else} Draw random number, $r \in [0,1]$ \\
\textsc{	If} $r \leq exp(-\Delta E \beta ) \quad \to$ Accept spin-flip. \\
\textsc{Else} $\quad \to$ Reject flip. 

\item Repeat step 2) - 4) long enough for the system to be 
uncorrelated.

\item Collect data of interest. 

\item Repeat step 2) - 6). 
\end{enumerate}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Choice of random number generator}
The pseudo random number generator used for the simulations in 
this report is the Mersenne Twister engine
instantiated with the parameters of 
\emph{Mersenne Twister 19937 generator} seeded with the time.
This generator is stored in each model, which makes 
parallelisation trivial.

The Mersenne Twister is available in the \texttt{<random>} header 
of the standard
library in C++ and has a period of the \emph{Mersenne number},
$2^{(n-1)w}-1$.
The instantiation chosen gives $w=32$ and $n=624$, and a period which is 
far larger than the minimum requirement.

\subsection{Computing thermodynamic properties}
The different thermodynamic properties of interest were computed 
according to the formulas \eqref{eq:Esum}, \eqref{eq:Msum} and
some modified formulas for the specific heat and magnetic susceptibility
are used.

These formulas can be justified by physical means, where $\sigma$ gives 
the changes the small perturbations in temperature when a flip happens.
The difference will be smaller if the system is tightly bound, and it 
does not induce a big change in the energy or magnetisation.

\subsubsection{Spesific heat}
\begin{equation}
C_v = \beta^2L^2\left(\expval{E^2} - \expval{E}^2\right)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Magnetic susceptibility}
\begin{equation}
\chi = \beta^2 L^2 \left(\expval{\magM^2} - \expval{\magM}^2\right)
\end{equation}

All these quantities are computed per particle and divided by the number 
of samplings. This gives specific heat and magnetic susceptibility 
per particle.

\subsection{Finite size scaling}

Near $T_C$ we can characterize the behavior of many physical quantities
by a power law behavior.
As an example the mean magnetization is given by
\begin{equation}
  \langle {\cal M}(T) \rangle \sim \left(T-T_C\right)^{\beta},
\end{equation}
where $\beta=1/8$ is a so-called critical exponent. A similar relation
applies to the heat capacity 
\begin{equation}
  C_V(T) \sim \left|T_C-T\right|^{\alpha},
\end{equation}
and the susceptibility
\begin{equation}
  \chi(T) \sim \left|T_C-T\right|^{\gamma},
\end{equation}
with $\alpha = 0$ and $\gamma = 7/4$.
Another important quantity is the correlation length, which is expected
to be of the order of the lattice spacing for $T>> T_C$. Because the spins
become more and more correlated as $T$ approaches $T_C$, the correlation
length increases as we get closer to the critical temperature. The divergent
behavior of $\xi$ near $T_C$ 
is
\begin{equation}
  \xi(T) \sim \left|T_C-T\right|^{-\nu}.
  \label{eq:xi}
\end{equation}
A second-order phase transition is characterized by a
correlation length which spans the whole system.
Since we are always limited to a finite lattice, $\xi$ will
be proportional with the size of the lattice. 
Through so-called finite size scaling relations
it is possible to relate the behavior at finite lattices with the 
results for an infinitely large lattice.
The critical temperature scales then as
\begin{equation}
 T_C(L)-T_C(L=\infty) = aL^{-1/\nu},
 \label{eq:tc}
\end{equation}
for a constant, $a$ and  $\nu$ (Hjort-Jensen, 2015). 


\subsection{Equilibration}
In this section we will look into how many Monte Carlo cycles are needed 
to reach the most likely state. This will be done by looking at a 
$20 \cross 20$-lattice for different dimensionless temperatures 
$\tilde{T}=1/\beta$, for both a ordered start configuration ("cold start") 
and a random start configuration ("hot start"). 
This will be done by an "by the eye"-approach, simply plotting the 
magnetisation and energy as a function of monte carlo cycles and see 
when they have only small fluctuations around some mean value. This will 
become later become out starting point for gathering data. The unstable 
phase before equilibrium is called \emph{thermalisation}.

We will also study the total number of accepted spin-flips as function of 
Monte Carlo cycles.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Numerical vs. analytical results for 2x2-case}

In figure \ref{fig:aE}, \ref{fig:aM}, \ref{fig:acv} and \ref{fig:achi}
the analytical expressions for the 2x2-case is compared to the numerical.
The energy from the Ising model is closely following the analytical 
expression, especially for low temperatures. For higher temperatures
the energy tends to deviate from the analytical expression. The 
numerical magnetisation is following the expression for low 
temperatures, but does not fall off as rapidly as the analytical result.

The specific heat for the numerical model closely resembles the analytical
expression. The discrepancy between the analytical result and numerical 
expression is due to numerical artefacts. The magnetic susceptibility
is significantly off. The reason for this has not been discovered.

\end{figure}







\subsubsection{Cold start and hot start}

Lattices which start out ordered and unordered has been compared. This 
results in the figures \ref{fig:EM_low_T} and \ref{fig:EM_high_T}. For low 
temperatures the ordered system starts out in the most likely state. For 
the unordered system to enter the same state, it needs about 30000 total 
flips, or about 75 trial flips per site to enter this state.

If the acceptances are compared, it 
results in the figures \ref{fig:ca_low_T} and \ref{fig:ca_high_T}.
These show that the ordered and unordered state has the flip-rate for 
high temperatures. For low temperatures the random start has a very high
acceptance rate, which slows down as it reaches the most likely state.
Thereafter the ordered and random start shows the same flip-rate.

the system change close to the critical temperature where the phase 
transition happens. After the phase transition all magnetization is gone.} 
\label{fig:equilibrium_T}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Computing the thermodynamic properties}

The probabilities of the different energies are in figure 
\ref{fig:dT1} and \ref{fig:dT2.4}, where 50000 samplings
has been made. For a temperature of 1, we get that
the lowest energy level is the most likely. The next energy level has a 
probability of 0.1, and the next one is even lower than this. 
Check again, compare with Boltzmann factor for T = 1.

A temperature of 2.4 gives a larger spread in the energy, with a 
peak around -500 and a larger spread. This resembles a 
Gaussian distribution.



\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{pics/dT=1.png}

\includegraphics[width=\figurewidth]{pics/{dT=2.4}.png}
\caption{Probabilities for the different energies for $\tilde{T}$ = 2.4}
\label{fig:dT2.4}
\end{figure}


By looking at the \cref{fig:e20,fig:e40,fig:e60,fig:e80},
 we see that the 
thermodynamic properties go through drastic changes in the interval
$\tilde{T}\in (2.0,2.4)$. This is the trace of the phase transition.
The magnetization goes to zero quickly, the energy increases.
This is all happening around the critical temperature 
$\tilde{T} \simeq  2.269 $.

The peaks for $C_v$ and $\chi$ gets narrower and higher, and has a tendency
to decrease towards the analytical critical temperature. The magnetisation
has a sharper cliff.

\subsubsection{The critical temperature and finite size scaling}
We will now see how close we can come to Lars Onsager's exact result of the critical temperature using the theory of finite size scaling from section 3.3.

From equation 3.10, using $\nu = 1$, having computed $T_C(L), L \in \{20,40,60,80 \}$ we have four equations and two unknowns. That means we can calculate sevral approximations for $a$, simply by subtracting one equation from the other. Obtaining the following expression for $a$:
\begin{equation}
a = \frac{T_C(L_j)-T_C(L_i)}{L_j - L_i}
\end{equation}

 We can do this for all the combinations of equation sets, and then compute an avarage value of $a$.

Finally, we can compute $T_C(L=\infty)$ using equation 3.10 and the numerical results above. Running the python script \texttt{finite\_size\_scaling.py} using the results from table 1 gives the following result:

\begin{framed}
\noindent
Finite size scaling approximation of T\_c:  2.27001284722 \\
Relative error:  0.00044638484893
\end{framed}

We have come very colse to Lars Onsager's original result of $T_C = 2.269$. 


\subsection{Reproduction of results}

Benchmark calculations along with the programs used are available 
along with the program. These are available under the Reproduction folder.
This requires setting the 
\url{global_seed} in \emph{main.cpp} to 42. More information is included
in the README in this folder.
