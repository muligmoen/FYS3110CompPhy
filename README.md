# FYS3150CompPhy

## Introduction
This repositry contains project files for the projects given by the course FYS3150/FYS4150 at the University of Oslo.


## Project 1
This project aims to solve the equation d^u/dx^2 = f(x). This is discretized and gotten in the form of a matrix equation,
Ax = g(x)
for a known function g(f(x)) and a tridiagonal matrix A.

This is achieved through LU-decomposition and an adaption of Thomas algorithm customized for this problem.

## Project 2 
This project aims to solve the radial part of the harmonic oscillator Schr√∂dinger equation for one and two electrons.
