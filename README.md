# FYS3150CompPhy

## Introduction
This repositry contains project files for the projects given by the course FYS3150/FYS4150 at the University of Oslo.


## Project 1
This project aims to solve the equation d^u/dx^2 = f(x). This is discretized and gotten in the form of a matrix equation,

Ax = g(x)

for a known function g(f(x)) and a tridiagonal matrix A.

This is achieved through LU-decomposition and an adaption of Thomas algorithm customized for this problem.

## Project 2 
This project aims to solve the radial part of the harmonic oscillator Schr√∂dinger equation for one and two electrons.

## Project 3
This projects computes the correlation energy between electrons in the helium atom, 
taking as ansatz two electrons in the hydrogen 1s orbitals.

## Project 4
This project computes the magnetism and energy in the two dimensional Ising model and finds the critical temperature.

## Project 5
This project explores the diffusion equation
